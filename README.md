# Capstone_Money
## What we know:
- Cost $25M to get into production
- Production costs will be $5M + $2M(t-1) for 5 years (t = 1,2,3,4,5)
  - Year 1: $5M + $2M(1-1) = $5M
  - Year 2: $5M + $2M(2-1) = $7M
  - Year 3: $5M + $2M(3-1) = $9M
  - Year 4: 
  - Year 5:
- Market estimated at 100,000 + 20(t-1) units per year(t)
- Prevailing interest rate of 5%

## What we need to find out:
- Sell Price in order to break even

## What needs to be done:
1. Develop a cash flow diagram and determine which of the table equations to use
